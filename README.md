# Welcome to my page! ⭐

On my page, I will post different achievments of mine, my skill sets, and more. I will do my best to update this as much as possible, but no promises! If you would like to contact me, you can do so through:

## Firstly, a little bit about me! 📊
I am 14 years old, and I have always had a passion for creating games, software, essentially any sort of program. I first learned I liked to program when I started creating games on the platform *Roblox*. I eventually ended up learning Python within my AP Computer Science Principles classroom (I had an easy time with this as I found the language to be quite similar to Lua, which I had learned creating games on Roblox.)

I ended up creating a few projects, most notablly my school system (which I am working on at this time), and a few others, such as a fishing game I created for my AP Create Preformance Task (this isn't uploaded to GitHub since it goes against the CollegeBoard terms.) Though my freshmen year was definetly a transitional period for me, causing for me to not preform at my best in most classes, I was able to grow and push myself to achieve as much as possible within this year, which I am very proud of!

## A little bit of my achievments! 🎗️

I got my entry level Python certificate from Python Institute during my freshmen year. Also during my freshmen year, I created a variety of projects, some of which you can see in my Respritories. I was also the captian of my chess team during the entirety of the chess clubs lifetime in middle school, and freshmen year in high school.

## My plans / the future! 🔮

I plan to learn C# and possibly C++ to create games within Unity and Unreal, as game design is still a big part of my passion for programming. I also want to learn JavaScript next year, and I would love to find a job over this upcoming summer, hopefully related to programming, to strengthen my soft skills like communication, problem solving, and more.
